# REPIC, an R-ArcGIS-based model

This repository includes R-ArcGIS and R-ArcGIS PRO interface toolboxes that facilitate the application of EPIC model simulations within the ArcGIS environment.
The code is embedded and can also be also only in R Studio.

## Overview
REPIC utilizes EPIC's capabilities while integrating seamlessly with ArcGIS, enhancing the user experience and providing a spatial context to simulation results.

### Future Improvements
The current interface of REPIC represents the initial version, and we are committed to ongoing improvements. The interface will be updated soon. Feedback and contributions from the community are welcome. Feel free to submit issues, suggest enhancements, or contribute to the development of a more robust and user-friendly interface.
